# Linx Challenge

As recommended, this project does not use front-end frameworks, it was developed using only HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I tried to make the layout as close as possible to the mockup.

[Live demo]()

## Challenge

The challenge is to develop the _layout_ of a _landing page_ with a product grid and a _newsletter_ form. Its main objective is to transform this _layout_ into a functional page.

**Layout Link**: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/4025e242-a495-4594-71d2-5fd89d774b57-3614/specs/

**API Endpoint**: https://frontend-intern-challenge-api.iurykrieger.now.sh/products?page=1

### Actions:

- For each **product** returned by the API, a ** product card ** with the respective information must be created in the product grid;
- By clicking on the button **Even more products here!** the next page of the API should be consulted, generating ** 8 more products ** in the existing grid, below the products already loaded by the first request;
- The _newsletter_ form with the title **Share the news** must have its _input_ fields validated according to the content (eg: the email field must contain a valid email);
